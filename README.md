📚 Library Management System (C++)
The Library Management System is a simple and easy-to-use console-based project made in C++.
It helps manage books, students, and issue/return records in a small library — all from the terminal.
No fancy setup, just pure C++ logic and file handling!

🚀 Features
Add new books with details like title, author, and ID
Search, modify, and delete existing book records
Issue and return books for students
Display complete book and issued-book lists
Stores data permanently using file handling

💡 Tech Used
Language: C++
Concepts: OOP (Classes, Objects, Inheritance), File Handling

🧠 How It Works
All data is saved in files (.txt format), so even after closing the program, your records stay safe.
The menu-driven interface makes it simple to navigate and perform operations quickly.

🧩 Why I Built This
I created this project to practice Object-Oriented Programming and understand how real-world systems like libraries can be automated using simple C++ logic.
